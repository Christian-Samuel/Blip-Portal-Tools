# How to use Blip Portal Tools

Now that you have this cool extension installed in your browser, let's see it in action.

This filter is added to the page so that bots can be separated according to the development environment.

<br></br>
Filtering takes place based on tags that are next to the bots name

<br></br>
If your team uses other TAGS to identify bots, just click on the pencil, and you can define which tags to use in each environment. Just define the tags once for each contract, as they are saved even if you close the page.

Another addition is this context menu which provides two quick clicks, a quick access to the builder and another to the settings of the selected bot.
